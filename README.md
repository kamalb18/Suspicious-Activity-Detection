# Suspicious-Activity-Detection

In today's world we can see the rate of doing crimes is increasing on a daily basis. To overcome this surveillance cameras have been installed but a surveillance cameras needs a person to have a constant watch to activities and to do this is a very tiring job. We, Tranqulizer, propose a model which helps us to detect the unusual activities and rules out the need of a person to have a constant watch and report the unusual activities.

The order to follow for preprocessing is:
  The folder named preprocessing contains three files for performing the task of preprocessing
(i) first run the file preprocess1.py \n
(ii) then run the file preprocess2.py \n
(iii) atlast run the file preprocess3.py

Training:
For Training purpose we have created a ipynb file namedd Tranquilizer.ipynb and 2 py files which are enclosed inside the folder named training.
